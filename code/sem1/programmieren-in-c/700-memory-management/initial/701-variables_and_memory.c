 /* Variables and memory
   have a look the variables in your previous programs, e.g. address_list.c

   TO DO 1: Use sizeof to determine how much memory different types require in memory.
   TO DO 2: Also consider arrays, structs, enums and unions.
   TO DO 3: Use & to determine the addresses of different variables in memory.
   TO DO 4: Can you see a difference of addresses for local and global variables?
   TO DO 5: How are variables sorted in memory (increasing or decreasing addresses)?
   TO DO 6: What about addresses of local variables in recursive functions (e.g. hanoi.c)?
   TO DO 7: Can you find int variables stored at uneven addresses? How do you judge the result?
   TO DO 8: What is the size of the following struct? Why? Can it be reduced?

	char a;

	char c;
	int d;
